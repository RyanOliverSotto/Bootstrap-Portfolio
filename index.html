                        alt="profile picture">
                    <p> My first Bachelors in Science was in psychology. I was always interested in theories that involved motivation,
                        cognition, and emotions. Let me bring up a theory I recall learning because I recently experienced
                        this phenomenon in 2016; it's called flashbulb memory. "A flashbulb memory is a highly detailed,
                        exceptionally vivid 'snapshot' of the moment and circumstances in which a piece of surprising and
                        consequential (or emotionally arousing) news was heard." I have had instances of flashbulb memories
                        dotted in various events in my life.</p>
                    <p> I can recall exact details of where I was, what I was doing, the weather, when the Space Shuttle Challenger
                        exploded (yes I am old.) I can recall every detail about my circumstances when I learned about the
                        sudden passing of my beloved grandfather when I was in my 20's. I recall bright and vivid details
                        when I came to learn about the deaths of Michael Jackson, Prince, and George Michael. Moving forward
                        in time, I can recall the very moment, when I learned that the job I held for 15+ years, the job
                        that defined me, provided me steady income, and encapsulated my entire existence for over a decade
                        was soon to end. I was working remotely that sunny early spring afternoon. It was one of those atypical
                        Chicago days with temperatures soaring higher than usual for the season. I had opened the windows
                        to dispel the stale air of my home office. I was about to wrap up my day and prepare for tomorrow's
                        agendas when I saw at 3:46PM CST, a meeting invite in my Outlook. The participants were only me,
                        my supervisor Catherine, and an unknown associate Crystal, whom I looked up in our resource library
                        as an HR rep from our HQ in St Louis. I knew immediately something was amiss. I quickly instant messaged
                        my boss.</p>

                    <blockquote>Me: "Cat, is everything all right? I see I have a meeting with you in 15 minutes."</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Cat: "Ryan, I'm afraid it's bad news."</blockquote>

                    <p> I know thousands of Americans have been laid off, but this event hit me very hard. I have had the good
                        fortune of lasting at the company as long as I did and achieving the accomplishments I have earned.
                        I could have easily gotten depressed and begin a fast downward spiral into madness, but not I. April
                        26th 2016 was the last time I clocked in as the team lead of SCRM, the position I held for years.
                        It was time for some new beginnings. Coicidentally, PokeMon Go debutted the very same season as my
                        lay off. I have some pretty rare Pokemon and a cracked IPhone to prove it. There is that overstated
                        saying, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." I know's it's
                        <em>cliche</em>, but it doesn't diminish the power of its simple philosphy. And make lemonaid I did,
                        gallons. I was able to secure a 10k grant to return to school for some retraining where was I able
                        to leverage my experience and education to obtain several flavors of IT Project Management certifications.
                        I immersed myself in the professional PM community here in Chicago, meeting so many wonderful new
                        associates, some of whom I now consider friends. My curiosity doesn't end with project management.
                        I was always interested in learning about website development and coding. When I came to learn about
                        Northwestern's fullstack coding bootcamp, I jumped on the opportunity. Maybe I can insert myself
                        into the development ecosystem as I have in project management. I think the two would be a wonderful
                        marriage of skillsets and expertise.</p>

                    <p> So yes, maybe when I receive my certificate of completion from this Coding Bootcamp program, a new flashbulb
                        memory will be logged in my mind.</p>
